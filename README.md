## What Is VoyageFlow?

VoyageFlow turns a normal conversation into a complete travel plan. Tell it where you want to go, when, and who's joining — it responds with a personalized, day-by-day itinerary written in a luxury-concierge voice, then generates a structured booking desk with deep links to search flights, hotels, tours, and insurance already pre-filled with the traveler's dates, destination, and party size.

As of **v2.4.0 + Week 5.1**, VoyageFlow is a **two-mode AI travel assistant with production-grade RAG**:

- **✈️ Plan a trip** — the itinerary planner + Booking Desk.
- **❓ Ask VoyageFlow** — factual Q&A grounded in a curated travel knowledge base with hybrid retrieval + cross-encoder reranking, visible citations, response caching, and prompt-injection defense.

An **intent classifier** auto-routes between the two modes, and **KV caching + rate limiting + a `/metrics` endpoint** keep it fast, cheap, and observable in production. No sign-up. No API key required from the user.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/james75x2-design/VoyageFlow/main/docs/architecture.png)

**Data flow — Chat mode**

1. User sends a message (mode toggle on **Plan a trip**, or auto-routed by the intent classifier).
2. Frontend POSTs `{ messages }` to the Cloudflare Worker.
3. Worker enforces per-IP rate limit, injects today's date, tries Gemini first, falls back through the Groq chain on failure.
4. Response returns as JSON with `reply` + `meta` (model, version, latency).
5. Frontend parses the embedded booking JSON block and renders the Booking Desk.

**Data flow — RAG mode (v2.4.0 + Week 5.1)**

1. User sends a message (mode toggle on **Ask VoyageFlow**, or auto-routed).
2. Frontend POSTs `{ mode: "rag", messages }`.
3. Worker enforces rate limit, then checks the **KV cache** — a hit returns instantly (zero AI calls).
4. On miss: **hybrid retrieval** (keyword + vector) → top-20 candidates → **cross-encoder reranker** → top-5.
5. Citation-enforced prompt sent to Gemini (with Groq fallback).
6. Response normalized into `{ answer_markdown, citations, unanswered, meta }`, **written to KV cache** (if answered), and returned.
7. UI strips inline `[chunk_id]` markers, renders the "Sources:" strip.

## 🧠 RAG Mode (v2.2.0 → v2.4.0)

### ✈️ Plan a trip (chat mode)
Describe your trip → VoyageFlow generates a bespoke day-by-day guide plus a Booking Demand Card with pre-filled search URLs.

### ❓ Ask VoyageFlow (RAG mode)
Ask factual questions about VoyageFlow itself — booking policies, verification guidance, destination coverage. Answers are grounded in a curated travel knowledge base with visible citations.

**How it works (v2.4.0):**

- **12 chunks embedded in the Worker** — no external vector DB
- **Hybrid retrieval** — keyword scoring + vector cosine similarity via `@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5`, fused 0.5/0.5
- **Cross-encoder reranker** — `@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base` refines top-20 → top-5
- **Citation enforcement** — hallucinated chunk IDs filtered before response
- **Prompt-injection defense** — verified in eval `vf-eval-006`
- **Out-of-scope refusal** — verified in evals `vf-eval-008` … `vf-eval-010`
- **Graceful fallbacks** — vector → keyword-only, reranker → hybrid fusion

---

## 🎯 Cross-encoder Reranker (v2.4.0)

```
Query
  ↓
Hybrid retrieval → top-20 candidate pool
  ↓
@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base → rescore candidates
  ↓
Top-5 (reranker order) → LLM prompt with citation enforcement
  ↓
Response: rerank_score in chunks_used, ranking_signal in meta
```

**Two Cloudflare Workers AI models running natively:**

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5` | 384-dim query + chunk embeddings |
| `@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base` | Cross-encoder rerank scoring |

Structured logs tag `retrieval_signal` (`hybrid` / `keyword_only`) and `ranking_signal` (`reranker` / `hybrid_fusion`) so fallbacks surface immediately.

---

## 🔌 MCP Tools

VoyageFlow runs a provider-agnostic **MCP-style tool loop**: the model requests a tool, the Worker executes it, feeds the result back, and the model composes a grounded answer. Tools are defined in `src/mcp/tools.mjs`.

| Tool | Backing service | Auth | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_transit_info` | MOTIS/Transitous geocoding + Transitland | Key for Transitland | Distance, transit time, mode, service frequency |
| `convert_currency` | Frankfurter (ECB reference rates) | Keyless | Converted amount, rate, rate date |

Both tools use a descriptive `User-Agent`, an 8-second timeout, and graceful error handling, and **never fabricate values** — a failed lookup returns `source: "none"` rather than a guess.

### Currency conversion

`convert_currency` answers budgeting questions ("how much is ¥15,000 in pesos?") using European Central Bank reference rates via the keyless Frankfurter API. It validates ISO currency codes, short-circuits same-currency requests without a network call, and always reports the **rate date** — Frankfurter publishes end-of-day rates, so weekend and holiday requests roll back to the last business day.

The response is deliberately honest about what the number is:

> 15,000 JPY is approximately 5,814 PHP. This is based on the central-bank reference rate from August 25, 2026, so do keep in mind that retail exchange rates might vary slightly.

Notably, VoyageFlow has **no intent-gating function** — no forced tool selection. The model picks `convert_currency` purely from its description, which proved sufficient in testing without any system-prompt nudging.

### Deterministic transit prefetch

Itinerary generation does **not** use the tool loop, and that's deliberate. An earlier version called `get_transit_info` from inside the loop, which meant every provider fallback (Gemini → Groq-120b → Groq-20b) re-ran the whole loop. With four destinations that reached ~12 transit fetches and ~48 subrequests — right at Cloudflare's 50-subrequest ceiling, causing intermittent failures.

The fix replaced narration-driven tool calls with a deterministic prefetch:

```
Itinerary request
  ↓
1. Planner pass — extract { base, destinations } as strict JSON
  ↓
2. Fetch transit data ONCE per destination
  ↓
3. Inject a TRANSIT FACTS block into the system prompt
  ↓
4. Generate the itinerary with plain generation (no tool loop)
```

This cut fetches from ~12 to 4 and subrequests from ~48 to 16, eliminated the failures, and **improved** output quality — because the facts arrive in the prompt rather than mid-conversation, the model sequences day-trips by distance, flags sparse service, and recommends walkable pairings. Non-itinerary turns and failed planner extraction fall back safely to the legacy tool-loop path.

`convert_currency` is intentionally excluded from the prefetch path so it cannot reintroduce subrequest amplification.

## 🧭 Intent Classifier (Week 5)

Auto-detects whether a query is "plan a trip" (chat/booking) or "ask a factual question" (RAG), so users don't have to manually toggle modes.

- **Regex-based heuristic** returning `rag` | `chat` | `null` (ambiguous)
- **Classify on-send** — runs once from the complete query at submit time (not mid-typing), avoiding jarring toggle flips and screen-reader noise
- **Manual lock** — clicking a toggle locks the choice; the classifier respects it
- **Auto-detect hint** — "🧭 Auto-detected: [mode]" shown when it switches

> Deliberately regex-only: VoyageFlow's two modes are lexically distinct enough that regex achieves high accuracy without the latency/cost of an LLM classification call. An LLM fallback tier could be added later if usage data shows a need.

**Verified (all 4 scenarios):** RAG auto-detect, chat auto-detect, manual override wins, ambiguous keeps current mode.

---

## ⚡ Response Caching + Rate Limiting + Metrics (Week 5.1)

Production hardening built on a shared KV-counter foundation.

### KV Response Caching
- Cache key: `rag:${KB_VERSION}:${sha256(query)}` — **KB-versioned** (rebuilding the KB orphans stale entries) and **hashed** (no truncation collisions)
- Only caches **answered, cited** responses (never refusals)
- 1-hour TTL; `meta.cache: "hit" | "miss"` for observability
- **Measured:** cache miss ~5s (full pipeline) → cache hit ~100ms (**~40x faster**)

### Rate Limiting
- Per-IP sliding window: **20 requests / 60s** → `429` when exceeded
- Protects Gemini/Groq calls + Cloudflare AI neuron budget
- **Verified:** requests beyond the limit correctly return `429`

### Cache Metrics
- `GET /metrics` → `cache_hits`, `cache_misses`, `total_rag_requests`, `cache_hit_rate`
- Counters increment on every RAG hit/miss via a shared `incrementCounter()` KV helper

---

## 📊 Evaluation

**93% pass rate** on the local eval harness (15 test cases including semantic queries, prompt injection, and out-of-scope refusal). Answer quality holds at **100%** — every case produces a correctly grounded, correctly refused, or correctly cited response:

| Metric | Week 2 baseline | Week 3 (hybrid) | Week 4 (reranker) | Current (expanded KB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total tests | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| Passed | 12 | 13 | **15** | 14 |
| Retrieval passed | 13 | 13 | **15** | 14 |
| Answer passed | 14 | 15 | **15** | **15** |
| Overall pass rate | 80% | 87% | **100%** | 93% |

The Week 4 run scored 100% against a smaller knowledge base. Adding the travel-insurance documents introduced new competition in the candidate pool, and `vf-eval-001` now retrieves `voyageflow-overview::004` outside the top 5 — though the answer still cites it correctly, so answer quality is unaffected. This is the expected trade-off of KB growth rather than a retrieval defect, and it is left visible here rather than tuned away.

### Hermetic mode — record once, replay free

The harness normally calls the live Worker for every case, which costs provider tokens and fails outright when quotas are exhausted. Hermetic mode removes that dependency:

```bash
EVAL_RECORD=1 node evals/eval.mjs      # run live, write evals/fixtures/<id>.json
EVAL_HERMETIC=1 node evals/eval.mjs    # replay fixtures — no network, no tokens
node evals/eval.mjs                    # unchanged live behaviour
```

Retrieval was already offline — `retrieve()` scores pre-embedded chunks locally with no network call — so only the generation step needed intercepting. Fixtures key off the stable test-case ids in `eval-data.json`, and a missing fixture fails loudly with the command needed to record it.

Crucially, **replay still exercises the full grading pipeline**. Retrieval scoring, citation validation, and failure categorisation all run against replayed answers, so hermetic runs catch grading regressions rather than skipping them. A recorded and a hermetic run produce byte-identical reports.

### Week 4 telemetry (all 15 tests)

```
Pipelines Used:     worker_rag: 15
Retrieval Signals:  hybrid: 15
Ranking Signals:    reranker: 15
Failure Categories: pass: 15
```

### Run the eval harness

```bash
node evals/eval.mjs
```

Writes `evals/eval-report.json` with per-test retrieval + answer scoring, latency, citation validation, pipeline/signal tags, and failure category.

**Force local hybrid path** (A/B or offline):

```bash
USE_WORKER_RAG=false node evals/eval.mjs
```

**Rebuild the embedded KB after editing `data/kb/*.md`:**

```bash
node src/rag/ingest-and-chunk.mjs
node scripts/embed-chunks.mjs
node scripts/build-worker-chunks.mjs
# then bump KB_VERSION in the worker and redeploy
npx wrangler deploy
```
